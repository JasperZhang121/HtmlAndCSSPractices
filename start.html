    <p> “Space… the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise, its five-year mission… to explore strange new words… to seek out new life and new civilizations… to boldly go where no man has gone before.”</p>
    
    
    <!-- This is first paragraph-->>
    <h3> Paragraph 1</h3>
    <p id="box1"> The introductory monologue by Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) invited viewers to join the crew of the starship Enterprise to watch a brand-new science fiction television series called Star Trek. Every week, households turned their television dial to NBC, where they witnessed series creator Gene Roddenberry’s vision of life in the 23rd century unfold in living color during the show’s initial three-year run that began on September 8, 1966.</p>

    <h3> Paragraph 2</h3>
    <p id="box2"> Those words that launched each opening episode were the result of a postwar popularization of space that was very much present at the time of Star Trek’s creation. A mid-century belief in the viability of space exploration saw a revitalization of the American frontier by those who sought to use the growing popularity of the nation’s space rhetoric to spread their message of exploration and conquest. This Cold War cultural effort to explore space reawakened a sense of manifest destiny in postwar America by reviving freedom, courage, and exceptionalism—the same ideals that originally drove expansionist boosters to America’s west. After all, how could a country that had tamed the great North American frontier by the end of the nineteenth century not succeed in conquering the frontier of space by the 23rd century?</p>

    <h3> Paragraph 3</h3>
    <p id="box3"> By the mid to late 1950s, space became the realm in which writers sought to understand and portray the changes that were rapidly occurring all around them. Science fiction mushroomed as new pulp magazines emerged to address the growing popular interest. As a result of the growing aerospace industry, trade publications such as Missiles and Rockets and Aviation Week either adapted their original editorial content or were founded anew to cover the broad spectrum of space-related, scientific, and engineering culture that began to emerge in this new industrial field.[1]</p>
    <p>        In the October 1956 premiere issue of Missile and Rockets, the publisher wrote, “This is the age of astronautics. This is the beginning of the unfolding of the era of space flight. This is to be the most revealing and the most fascinating age since man first inhabited the earth.”[2]</p>


    <h3> Paragraph 4</h3>
    <p id="box4"> In the midst of the Cold War, space started to become a real place in popular culture as both fiction and fact began riding on the back of a galloping technology and could not dismount for fear of breaking their necks. Together, they were on a convergent course, and the lines separating fact from fiction became more blurred. Nonfiction books that romanticized humanity’s future in the new frontier of space started to borrow the look and feel of many of the popular pulps.</p>

    <h3> Paragraph 5</h3>
    <p id="box5">This essay attempts to explore the origins of some of the national space rhetoric that appeared during the Cold War, the way its use in political documents, congressional reports and campaigns tells us something about the self-image of Americans in the early to mid 1960s, and how this rhetoric may have influenced Gene Roddenberry during the creation of his pioneering and highly influential television series Star Trek.</p>
